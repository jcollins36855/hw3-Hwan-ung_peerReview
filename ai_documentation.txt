Assignment: STAT159 HW3 (MyST + GitHub Pages)
AI Tool: ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Prompts:

- How to automatically deploy a MyST site using GitHub Actions
- Detailed structure and purpose of each Makefile target (env / html / clean)
- Whether _toc.yml can replace toc: inside myst.yml
- What happens when figures/ and audio/ are included in .gitignore
- Diagnosing common MyST deploy failures (GitHub Actions / Pages)

Key outputs (summary):

- .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- Makefile automating environment setup (env), local HTML build (html), and cleanup (clean)
- _toc.yml can be used instead of the inline toc: section in myst.yml when custom navigation or ordering is needed. MyST automatically prioritizes _toc.yml if present.
- Including figures/ and audio/ in .gitignore would not delete existing files but would stop tracking new ones — this is typically avoided if the folders contain outputs referenced in the site or report.

- MyST Deploy Failure – Cause Analysis

When deployment initially failed, the most common causes identified were:

Incorrect workflow path – The .github/workflows folder or YAML filename did not match the expected naming convention (pages.yml, deploy.yml, etc.).

Build directory mismatch – GitHub Actions uploaded _site while MyST generated _build/html, leading to “empty site” deployments.

Improper YAML indentation – A small indentation error in the workflow (e.g., under jobs: or with:) prevented the Action from executing configure-pages.

Missing MyST installation – The workflow lacked npm install -g mystmd, so the site never built.

Permissions not set – The workflow’s permissions: block was missing contents: read, pages: write, or id-token: write.

Branch mismatch – The trigger (on: push: branches: [main]) did not align with the active branch.
